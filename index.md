subtitle:  Foodie / Software Developer / Backpacker

Hii I am Anubhav, final year Computer Science Undergrad at IIT Ropar. I love travelling and travelled across 8 countries(way more to go). If I had enough money to travel, you'll never see me again. I like to take the hard way of life without caring about the risks. I love solving real life challenges.

I believe in self learing as I haven't got a good experience of learing from my college. I am a self taught person. Still searching for a good teacher.

Being a CSE student my primary interests are in Machine learing and Virtualization technologies. Apart from that startups interests me a lot. I believe that computers are modern world's superpowers.
I like to learn something new everyday. 

I still haven't figured out what to do with my life but till then I am actively looking for job opportunites. You can [contact](/contact) me here.
